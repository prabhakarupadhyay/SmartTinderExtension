"""
Exports the embeddings and labels of a directory of images as numpy arrays.

Typicall usage expect the image directory to be of the openface/facenet form
and the images to be aligned. Simply point to your model and your image
directory:
python facenet/contributed/export_embeddings.py
 ~/models/facenet/20170216-091149/ ~/datasets/lfw/mylfw

Output:
embeddings.npy -- Embeddings as np array, Use --embeddings_name to change name
labels.npy -- Integer labels as np array, Use --labels_name to change name
label_strings.npy -- Strings from folders names,
 --labels_strings_name to change name


Use --image_batch to dictate how many images to load in memory at a time.

If your images aren't already pre-aligned, use --is_aligned False

I started with compare.py from David Sandberg, and modified it to export
the embeddings. The image loading is done use the facenet library if the image
is pre-aligned. If the image isn't pre-aligned, I use the compare.py function.
I've found working with the embeddings useful for classifications models.
