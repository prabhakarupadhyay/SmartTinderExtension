# SmartTinderExtension

This is a chrome extension which enables you to auto swipe tinder profiles on web.
It contains:
  - Chrome extension folder which is supposed to be installed manually in chrome extensions
  - Tindetheus folder which is inspired https://github.com/cjekel/tindetheus containing ML libraries for learning profile data. It contains a flask server that needs to be hosted or run locally for the system to work.

You need to download a facenet library https://github.com/davidsandberg/facenet#pre-trained-models for other pretrained facenet models. 
  - Im using 20170512-110547 version of the library. Include it in tindethues folder before running the flask server.
